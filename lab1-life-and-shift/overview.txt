We created an m1.large from the linux OS AMI and will populate it at launch by curling to a bash script then piping it into sh.

EC2 instances are attached EBS (Elastic Block Storage) ... basically AWS disk drives

We associate the security group to the EC2 instance so it knows what's allowed to reach it.

Ah-ha, the tutorial delibrately makes us misconfigure the key-pair so now we tag the instance so that we know which keypair is allowed to SSH into it.
